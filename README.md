# Data-Quality-Assessment-and-Customer-Segmentation-for-Sprocket-CentraL
This project aims to assess data quality and perform customer segmentation for Sprocket Central. The project will review data accuracy, address missing information, and suggest improvements. After cleaning the data, customer segments will be identified through statistical or machine learning models. 




__Data Quality Assessment and Customer Segmentation for Sprocket Central__
This project is aimed at performing a data quality assessment and customer segmentation for Sprocket Central. The purpose of the data quality assessment is to check the data for accuracy and completeness so that it can be used for analysis. The customer segmentation will help to identify high-value customers based on their demographics and attributes.

Requirements
The following packages and software are required to run the project:

Python 3.x
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
Excel
Data Quality Assessment
The first task of this project is to perform a data quality assessment. The following steps were taken to perform the assessment:

Check the data for accuracy and completeness
Look for problems or missing information
List the things to ask the client about
Offer suggestions to improve the data quality
The data quality assessment found issues with inconsistent customer IDs and inconsistent data types. Recommendations were made to use only customers listed in the "Customer Master" table, converting certain records to numeric values, and adding constraints to data types.

Customer Segmentation
The second task of this project is to perform customer segmentation. The following steps were taken to perform the customer segmentation:

Analyze the data distributions to understand the data
Use feature engineering to improve the analysis
Transform the data into a usable format
Apply statistical or machine learning models
Interpret the results and explain the findings
Present the results to the client
Divide customers into segments
Target high-value customers
The customer segmentation was performed using K-Means and PCA algorithms. The data was analyzed, transformed, and feature engineered to identify patterns and group customers together. The results were presented to the client and high-value customers were targeted.

Data Exploration and Preprocessing
The data was explored and preprocessed using the following steps:

Identification of variables and data types
Analyzing the basic metrics
Missing value treatment
Non-Graphical Univariate Analysis
Graphical Univariate Analysis
Bivariate Analysis
Feature Engineering
Variable transformations
Outlier treatment
The data was first imported into a Python environment and the variables and data types were identified. The data was then analyzed and missing values were treated. The data was then transformed and feature engineered to improve the analysis.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the project was successful in performing a data quality assessment and customer segmentation for Sprocket Central. The data quality assessment found issues with the data and made recommendations for improvement. The customer segmentation identified high-value customers and divided them into segments. The results were presented to the client and the project was deemed a success.
